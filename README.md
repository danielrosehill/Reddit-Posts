# Reddit Posts
 
 The purpose of this repository is to create an archive of some posts that I've created on Reddit or other social networks and which I might want to use in AI workflows - for example by providing a link to this repository to an AI tool for scraping or ingesting it as context data. 

 The majority of threads posted here will probably relate to questions in AI development forums regarding specific workflows or architectures. 

 ## Text Processing Assistant

 When leveraging external data as context for AI systems, it's useful in my experience to preprocess it to optimize its format - attempting, basically, to increase the signal:noise ratio as far as possible. 

 To assist with that process, I created a basic social post processing assistant to system prompt is in this repository. Its task is lightly editing social posts to eliminate non useful elements for this purpose.
